First, determine the practitioner's skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced, elite) based on movement fluidity, technical precision, and conceptual understanding.

Structure your analysis as follows:

## SKILL ASSESSMENT
Categorize the practitioner's level with specific observations of their technical execution. Example: "Intermediate: Shows understanding of basic mechanics but struggles with weight distribution during transitions."

## KEY STRENGTHS (2-3)
‚Ä¢ Identify technically sound elements with timestamps  
‚Ä¢ Explain why these elements demonstrate good Jiu-Jitsu

## CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS (2-3)
‚Ä¢ Pinpoint the highest-leverage technical corrections needed with timestamps  
‚Ä¢ Explain the biomechanical principles being violated  
‚Ä¢ Note potential consequences in live rolling scenarios

## SPECIFIC DRILLS (1-2)
‚Ä¢ Prescribe targeted exercises that address the identified weaknesses  
‚Ä¢ Explain the correct feeling/sensation to aim for when practicing

## COACHING INSIGHT
One key conceptual understanding that would elevate their game

## STUDENT TAKEAWAY
A memorable principle they should internalize (think: "Position before submission")

Use precise BJJ terminology while remaining accessible. Balance encouragement with honest technical assessment. Keep your analysis under 400 words total.
